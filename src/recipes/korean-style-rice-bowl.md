**Prep time.** Drain the tofu, dry it well by patting it with kitchen roll, then chop into 2cm cubes. Coarsely grate the carrot, slice the pepper into thin strips, and chop the broccoli into florets. Grate the garlic, then zest and halve the lime.

**Cook the rice.** Pour 300ml of water into a pan. Stir in the rice and 1/4 tsp salt. Cover and bring to a boil on medium-high heat. Once boiling, turn heat to low and leave to cook for 10 minutes. Remove pan from heat, leave covered for another 10 minutes.

**Make the spicy sauce.** In a bowl, mix the chipotle paste with the rice vinegar, ginger puree, garlic and half the soy sauce. In another bowl, drizzle half the sesame oil onto the grated carrot. Add a squeeze of lime juice, a pinch of lime zest, mix well and set aside.

**Steam the broccoli.** Heat a frying pan over high heat with a splash of oil. Add the broccoli and stir-fry for 2 minutes. Add a good splash of water and cover with a lid. Lower the heat and cook until the broccoli is tender, 3-5 minutes. Transfer to a plate when done.

**Brown the tofu.** Return the frying pan to a high heat and add a glug of oil. Once hot, add the tofu to the pan and stir-fry until browned, taking care not to break the tofu, 4-5 minutes. When browned, lower the heat slightly and add the pepper and cook until softened, another 4-5 minutes. Add the spicy sauce, stir to combine and heat until piping hot, 2 minutes. Season to taste.

**Serve.** Share the rice between the bowls and drizzle on a little of the remaining soy sauce. Cover one third of the rice with the carrot salad, another with the broccoli and a final third with the tofu. Finish with a sprinkle of sesame seeds, a drizzle of sesame oil, the remaining lime zest and a squeeze of lime.
