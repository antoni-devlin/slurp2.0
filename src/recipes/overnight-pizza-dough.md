**Start the dough.** The night before, put 300g of the flour, the yeast, salt, oil, and 300ml of lukewarm water into a bowl. Mix well to form a claggy dough. Don't worry if it looks sticky, it should be very wet rather than a stiff dough that you can knead. Cover with clingfilm, and leave in a cool-ish place overnight (but not in the fridge).

**Finish the dough.** Shortly before you're ready to make the pizzas, sprinkle over the remaining 150g of flour. Knead for a minute in the bowl to combine, then knead for 10 minutes on a lightly floured work surface until smooth. Transfer to a clean oiled bowl to rest for 30 minutes while you pre-heat the oven and prep the toppings.
