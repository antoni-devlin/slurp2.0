**Preheat oven**. Preheat the oven to 230C (or 210 for fan-assisted ovens). Pour a drizzle (enough to cover the whole base) of vegetable (or sunflower) oil into each hole of a cupcake tin. Put this in the oven now to heat up.

**Make the batter.** Put the flour in a mixing bowl and beat in the eggs until combined. Slowly add the milk, whisking as you go, to get rid of any lumps. Season the batter with salt and pepper, and transfer into a jug.

**Baking time!** Remove the cupcake tin from the oven â€“ the oil should now be really hot. Divide the batter evenly between the cupcake tin holes, and put back in the oven. Leave to bake for 20-25 minutes until puffed up and golden. DO NOT OPEN THE OVEN DURING COOKING, OR THEY MAY COLLAPSE.

**Serve**. Serve alongside a full Sunday Roast, preferably filled with gravy.

Common problems: Not beating enough air into the batter, iol not hot enough, or opening the oven during cooking time can all cause these to come out flat.
