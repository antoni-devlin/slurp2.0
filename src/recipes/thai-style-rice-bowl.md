**Cook the rice**. Pour 300ml of water into a pan. Stir in the rice and 1/4 tsp salt. Cover and bring to a boil on medium-high heat. Once boiling, turn heat to low and leave to cook for 10 minutes. Remove pan from heat, leave covered for another 10 minutes.

**Prep the veggies**. Chop the shallot into small pieces, grate the garlic, and finely chop the red chilli. Thinly slice the spring onion. Trim the green beans then chop into thirds.

**Stir fry the green beans**. Add oil to a frying pan on high heat. Once hot, add the green beans and stir-fry until tender, about 5-6 minutes. Transfer to a plate when cooked.

**Cook the mince**. Add the Quorn mince to the pan on high heat and stir fry until cooked. Add the shallot, garlic, spring onion, and chilli. Cook until the veggies are softened, around 2-3 minutes.

**Bring back the beans.** Return the green beans to the pan, add the ketjap manis and soy sauce and stir everything together.

**Finish and serve**. Roughly chop the coriander and mix in with the mince. Divide the rice between the bowls, and top with the mince.
