**Roast the aubergine.** Preheat the oven to 200C. Trim the aubergine then halve lengthways. Chop each half into four long strips then halve widthways. Pop the aubergine pieces onto a large baking tray. Drizzle with oil, sprinkle over the Chinese Five spice and season with salt and pepper. Toss to coat, then arrange in a single layer. Roast the aubergine on the top shelf until golden brown and soft, 25-30 minutes, turning halfway through.

**Finish the prep.** Halve, peel and thinly slice the onion. Trim the carrot and thinly slice into rounds. Halve the mangetout lengthways. Trim and thinly slice the spring onion. Peel and grate the garlic.

**Toast the sesame seeds.** Heat a frying pan over medium-high heat (no oil). Once hot, add the sesame seeds and cook, stirring regularly, until lightly toasted, 1-2 minutes. Once toasted, transfer to a small bowl and pop the pan back on a medium-high heat.

**Cook the veg.** Add a drizzle of oil to the pan and add the onion and carrot. Season with salt and pepper and stir-fry until they are both nicely softened and golden, 607 minutes. Stir in the garlic and mangetout, stir and cook for 1-2 minutes. Gently separate the noodles and add them to the pan as well.

**Combine.** Add the szechuan paste, soy sauce and 50ml water. Bring to the boil and simmer until the mixture is piping hot and the sauce coats the veg and noodles, 1-2 minutes. Add the sesame seeds and stir to combine. Taste and add salt and pepper if you feel it needs it.

**Serve.** Serve the noodles in bowls, top with the roasted aubergine and spring onion sprinkled on top.
