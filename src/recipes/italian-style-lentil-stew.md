**Prepare the veg.** Finely slice the leeks, finely chop the celery sticks, peel and dice the parsnips, peel and dice the carrot, finely chop 2 garlic cloves and halve 1 the remaining garlic clove.

**Start the stew.** Heat 2 tbsp oil in a large, lidded saucepan over a medium-high heat. Add the leeks and cook for 5 minutes. Add the chopped garlic, celery, parsnips, and carrot and cook for 5 more minutes.

**Simmer time.** Add the lentils, tomato puree, chilli flakes, and vegetable stock. Bring to the boil, cover and simmer over a low heat for 35 minutes until the lentils are soft. Stir in the kale and simmer for 5 minutes more until the vegetables are all tender and the stew is thick and soupy. Season to taste.

**Serve.** Toast the bread, then rub on both sides with the cut sides of the garlic clove. Brush with the remaining oil, season and halve diagonally. Spoon over the stew, and serve with the lemon wedges to squeeze over.
