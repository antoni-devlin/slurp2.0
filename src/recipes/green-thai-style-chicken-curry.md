**Prep the veggies**: Trim the green beans, and chop into thirds. Halve the red pepper, and discard the core and seeds. Slice into thin strips. Roughly chop the coriander (stalks and all)

**Start the curry**: Heat a splash of oil in a large frying pan on medium-high heat. Add the chicken and stir-fry until starting to brown, 3-4 mins. Add the pepper and green beans, and stir-fry for another minute.

**Simmer the curry**: Stir in the Thai green curry paste and cook for 30 seconds. Pour in the coconut milk, stir to dissolve the paste. Lower the headt to medium, cover with a lid (or foil) and simmer until the chicken is cooked through, 8-10 mins and the veg is tender.

**Cook the Rice**: Meanwhile, cook the rice according to pack instructions.

**Finish off**: Chop the lime into wedges. Once the curry is cooked, remove from the heat, stir through the soy sauce and add a squeeze of lime juice. Season to taste.

**Serve**: Share the rice between your bwols topped with the curry and a sprinkling of coriander. Finish with remaining lime wedges.

Feel free to replace the chicken with butternut squash!
