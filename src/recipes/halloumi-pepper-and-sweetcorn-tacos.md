**Get prepped.** Halve and thinly slice the shallot. Chop the pepper into chunks. Drain the sweetcorn and pinto beans. Chop the halloumi into 2cm chunks. Preheat the oven to 180C.

**Cook the beans**. Add some oil to a saucepan and fry paprika and cumin for 30 seconds. Add the beans and some water. Cook on a medium heat until the beans are cooked and the water is absorbed. Add more water if dry.

**Fry the veg**. Heat some oil in a frying pan on a medium-high heat. Add the pepper and sweetcorn. Season with salt and pepper, stir fry until the pepper has softened and the sweetcorn has coloured slightly, 4-5 minutes. Add the shallot and fry until soft, 3-4 minutes.

**Make the mayo.** Put the mayo in a bowl and add the chipotle paste. Mix together and put aside. Thinly slice the spring onion.

**Fry the cheese**. Once the veggies are soft, remove them to a bowl and put the frying pan back on a medium-high heat with a drizzle of oil. Add the halloumi and fry until golden brown on all sides, 5-6 minutes. Put the wraps in the oven to warm through for 2-3 minutes.

**Finish and serve**. Spread the chipotle mayo evenly on each of the tacos. Add a layer of beans. Divide the veg, then sprinkle over the halloumi and spring onion.
