**Cook the sausages**. Preheat the oven and cook sausages according to packet instructions.

**Cook the pasta**. Fill a large saucepan with water, add 1/2 teaspoon salt, and bring to the boil. Once boiling, add the linguine and cook for 12 minutes. When cooked, drain in a colander, return to the pan off the heat and drizzle in some oil to stop it sticking together.

**Prepare the veggies**. Finely dice the onion and garlic. Chop the courgette and red pepper into small pieces. Heat a frying pan with a drizzle of oil over a medium-high heat and cook the onion until soft, around 5 minutes. Add the garlic, courgette, and pepper, and sprinkle over some oregano. Cook for 2 more minutes.

**Make the sauce**. Add the chopped tomatoes, a good glug of Worcester sauce, a glug of red wine, and a pinch of sugar. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat to medium and simmer until the sauce is thick and tomatoey, 5-6 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add some fresh cherry tomatoes if you have any!

**Finish up.** Remove the sausages from the oven and slice into small pieces. Add to the sauce and mix together. Add the linguine and toss through to combine. Serve in bowls and top with cheese.
