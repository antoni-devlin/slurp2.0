**Get prepped.** Finely dice the shallot. Peel the sweet potato and chop into 2cm chunks. Grate the garlic and ginger. Zest the lime and cut into wedges. Drain the chickpeas.

**Cook the rice.** Pour 300ml of water into a pan. Stir in the rice and 1/4 tsp salt. Cover and bring to a boil on medium-high heat. Once boiling, turn heat to low and leave to cook for 10 minutes. Remove pan from heat, leave covered for another 10 minutes.

**Toast the cashews.** Heat a large saucepan on a medium-high heat with no oil. Add the cashews and toast, 2-3 minutes. Remove from the pan and place in a small bowl. Return the pan to a medium-high heat with a drizzle of oil. Add the shallot and fry until softened, 3-4 minutes.

**Make the curry.** Stir in the ginger, Thai yellow curry paste, and half the garlic. Cook for 1 minute. Stir in the sweet potato, chickpeas, 200ml water, vegetable stock cube, coconut milk, and peanut butter. Stir to mix, ensuring that the peanut butter has combined, 2-3 minutes. Bring to the boil, then reduce to a simmer. Put the lid on, stirring frequently, until the sweet potato is tender, 15-20 minutes.

**Cook the spinach.** About 6-8 minutes before your curry is ready, heat a drizzle of oil in a frying pan on a medium-high heat. When hot, add the spinach a handful at a time and allow it to wilt slightly, 1-2 minutes. Once it begins to wilt, add the ketjap manis and the remaining garlic and stir fry until some of the liquid has evaporated, 2-3 minutes.

**Plate up.** Stir the lime zest through the rice and share between the bowls. Add a squeeze of lime juice to the curry and season with salt and pepper. Spoon the curry on one side of the rice and the spinach on the other. Sprinkle on the cashews.
