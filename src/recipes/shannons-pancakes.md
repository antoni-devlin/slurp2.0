**Make the buttermilk.** Pour milk into jug and squeeze in juice of half a lemon. Set aside.

**Mix dry ingredients.** Put flour in a mixing bowl and add bicarbonate of soda, baking powder, and sugar. Mix together.

**Make the batter.** Add the melted butter to the dry ingredients and mix until incorporated. Beat in the egg, then slowly add the milk, beating until no lumps remain. Leave to rest for five minutes.

**Cook the panc.** Melt a knob of butter in a frying pan over medium heat. Once melted, add a ladle-full of batter to the pan. Leave to cook until bubbles form on the surface and edges begin to brown, then flip. Cook for another 30 seconds or so until cooked and transfer to plate. Repeat for remaining batter.
