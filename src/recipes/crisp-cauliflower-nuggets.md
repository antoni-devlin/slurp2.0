**Coat the cauliflower.** Preheat the oven to 200C. Separate the cauliflower into florets and put in a mixing bowl. Season with salt and pepper and stir in the mayonnaise. Mix until the florets are well coated. In another small bowl, mix the panko breadcrumbs with some Central American spice mix. Season with salt and stir in a glug of oil. Trip the crumbs onto the florets and toss to coat evenly.

**Roast the florets.** Transfer the florets to a lined baking tray and roast on the top shelf of the oven until golden and crispy, 20-25 minutes.

**Prep the veggies.** Drain the cannellini beans. Transfer a third to a bowl and crush with a fork. Chop the courgette into small chunks, then grate the garlic. Finely dice the chilli and roughly chop the coriander.

**Cook the bulgar wheat.** Add the bulgar wheat to a saucepan, and pour over some vegetable stock until well covered. Cook on a medium high heat, adding more stock when needed, until the bulgar is cooked (around 10 minutes).

**Start the stew.** Heat a splash of oil in a large saucepan over a medium-high heat. Add the courgette and cook, stirring for 3 mins. Stir in the garlic and some more Central American spice mix and cook for 1 minute. Add the chopped tomatoes and 75ml of water. Bring to a simmer, and leave to bubble away for 5 minutes. Add the whole and crushed beans to the stew, and cook until thick, around 5-6 minutes.

**Finish off.** Stir half the coriander into the stew, then remove from the heat. Season with salt and pepper, and add the chilli.

**Serve.** Spoon the bulgar wheat into bowls, then add the bean stew. Top with the cauliflower nuggets and a dollop of sour cream (optional), and finish with a sprinkling of coriander.
