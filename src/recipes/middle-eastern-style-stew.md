**Cook the mince.** Finely dice an onion and 2 cloves of garlic. Heat oil in a frying pan on a medium-high heat and fry the onion until soft, around 5 minutes. Add garlic and the Quorn mince and fry until cooked.

**Prep the veggies.** Slice the pepper into thin strips. Slice the courgette into rounds about 1cm thick. Zest and halve the lemon.

**Make the stew.** Once the mince is cooked, add the pepper and cook until starting to soften, around 6-7 minutes. Add the chermoula, stir and cook for 1 minute more. Pour in the chopped tomatoes and 150ml of water, then crumble in a stock cube. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and leave to simmer until thick and tomatoey, 15-20 minutes.

**Cook the couscous.** Boil the kettle. Put the couscous in a bowl, add the lemon zest and a drizzle of olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Pour 240ml of boiling water in the bowl, cover tightly with cling film and leave for 10 minutes.

**Char the courgette.** Heat a frying pan on high heat with no oil. Add the courgette and leave to cook until charred, 4-5 minutes on each side. Transfer to a plate, sprinkle with salt and pepper and set aside.

**Season and serve**. Season the stew to taste with salt and pepper. Fluff up the couscous with a fork and add a squirt of lemon juice. Divide between the bowls, spoon over the stew, and top with courgette and crumbled feta.
