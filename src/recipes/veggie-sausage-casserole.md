**Cook the sausages.** Heat the oil in a large, shallow casserole dish set over a medium heat. Add the sausages and cook for 3-5 minutes until lightly browned all over. Remove and set aside.

**Prep the veggies.** Thinly slice the onion, grate the garlic, and chop the butternut squash into 2cm cubes. Drain the beans.

**Start the casserole.** Add the onion to the casserole dish and fry over medium-high heat until softened, around 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic, cumin and coriander and cook for 1 minute more.

**Cook the casserole.** Add the tomatoes, beans, and 350ml boiling water. Stir in the vegetable stock cube and the mango chutney. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes.

**Finish up.** Return the sausages to the dish along with the butternut squash. Cover and cook for 15 minutes more until the squash is cooked through. Stir in the spinach and cook until just wilted. Sprinkle with parsley and season to taste before serving.
