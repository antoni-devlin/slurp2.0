**Roast the aubergine.** Preheat oven to 200C. Chop the aubergine into 2cm chunks, place on a baking tray, drizzle with oil, season with salt and pepper, and sprinkle over the North Indian spice mix. Toss to cost, then arrange in a single layer. Roast for 25-30 minutes.

**Onion time.** Chop the onion into small pieces. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large saucepan over medium high heat. Once hot, add the onion and cook, stirring until softened and turning brown, 5-6 minutes.

**Add the flavour.** Add the korma paste and cook, stirring for 1 minute. Add the passata, lentils, 350ml water, vegetable stock powder, 1/2 tsp sugar, and season with salt and pepper. Once boiling, lower the heat to medium and cook until the lentils are soft, 20-25 minutes. Stir regularly to make sure it doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan and add a splash of water if it is starting to get too thick.

**Cook the rice.** Pour 300ml water into a saucepan and bring to the boil. When boiling, add 1/4 tsp of salt, add the rice, lower the heat to medium and pop a lid on the pan. Leave to cook for 10 minutes, then remove the pan from the heat (still covered) and leave to the side for another 10 minutes or until ready to serve.

**Finish the dahl.** Roughly chop the coriander. Once the lentils are cooked, add the spinach a handful at a time, stirring, until wilted and piping hot, 2-3 minutes. Stir through half the roasted aubergine, half the Greek yoghurt and half the coriander. Season to taste.

**Serve**. Divide the rice between plates. Top with the dahl, add the remaining roasted aubergine and remaining yoghurt. Scatter over the remaining coriander.
