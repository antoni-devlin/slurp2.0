**Prep.** Chop the onion into small pieces. Peel and grate the garlic. Halve the pepper, discard the core and seeds, and chop into 1cm size chunks. Trim the green beans and chop into thirds. Trim the courgette, quarter lengthways, and cut into 1cm chunks.

**Cook the rice.** Put 300ml water in a saucepan and bring to the boil. Add 1/4 tsp salt and the rice, put a lid on the pan, and lower the heat to medium. Cook for 10 minutes, then remove the pan from the heat and set aside for another 10 minutes or until you are ready to serve.

**Start the curry.** Heat a drizzle of oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat and add the onion. Cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and starting to golden, 6-7 minutes. Add the pepper, stir and cook for 1 minute. Stir in the tandoori masala mix, and a pinch of chilli flakes, and cook for 30 seconds. Now add the ginger, garlic, and tomato puree, stir and cook for another 30 seconds.

**Cook the curry.** Pour in 150ml water, the creme fraiche, coconut milk and vegetable stock powder. Bring to the boil, stirring to combine, then reduce the heat to medium, stir in the green beans and courgette, cover the pan with a lid and simmer until the veg are almost tender, 8-9 minutes. Remove the the lid and allow to simmer until the mixture has thickened and the veggies are cooked through, 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally.

**Finish up.** Roughly chop the coriander. When the curry is cooked season to taste and stir in half the coriander.

**Serve.** Fluff up the rice with a fork. Serve the rice in bowls topped with plenty of veggie tikka and the remaining coriander.
