**Roast the sweet potato.** Preheat oven to 200C. Chop the sweet potato into wedges, place on a baking tray, drizzle with oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast in the oven for 25-30 mins.

**Prep and cook the veggies**. Thinly slice the onion, grate the garlic, and drain the kidney beans. Fry the onion in a frying pan on a medium-high heat for 5-6 minutes until softened. Stir in the garlic and Mexican spice and cook for 1 minute. Pour in the tomato passata, 400ml of water, a vegetable stock cube, and the lentils. Season with salt and pepper, bring to the boil, reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the lentils are tender, 20-25 minutes. Stir in the kidney beans halfway through cooking.

**Prep the salsa.** Zest and halve the lime. Thinly slice the spring onion. Quarter the baby plum tomatoes. Chop the avocado into small 1cm chunks.

**Finish the salsa.** Squeeze half the lime juice into a bowl and add 1 tbsp of olive oil. Season with salt and pepper and mix together. Add the tomatoes and avocado and stir together.

**Finish and serve.** Once cooked, stir the BBQ sauce into the chilli. Serve the sweet potato wedges with veggie chilli spooned over and the salsa sprinkled on top, followed by the spring onion and lime zest. Serve the remaining lime cut into wedges for squeezing over.
