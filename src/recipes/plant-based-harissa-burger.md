**Wedge it**. Preheat your oven to 200ÂºC. Chop the potatoes into 2cm wedges (no need to peel). Pop the wedges on a low sided wide baking tray in a single layer. Drizzle with oil, then season with salt and pepper. Toss to coat, then spread out. ONce your oven is hot, roast on the top shelf of your oven until golden, 25-30 mins. Turn halfway through cooking.

**Prep time**. Halve the baby plum tomatoes, trim the root from the baby gem lettuce then halve lengthways. Thinly sliced widthways. Trim and thinly slice the spring onion. Pop the tomato, lettuce and spring onion into a large bowl.

**Burger O'Clock**. About 10 minutes before the wedges are done, heat a drizzle of oil in a large frying pan on a medium-high heat. When hot, add the plant-based burgers and cook on each side until golden brown, 4-5 mins per side. When cooked, add half of the harissa paste to the pan and turn to coat the burgers. Remove from heat.

**Finish**. Halve the burger buns and warm through in the oven, 2-3 mins. Drizzle the red wine vinegar and olive oil onto the tomato and lettuce and season with salt and pepper. Toss to combine.

**Finish off.** Spread the remaining harissa paste between the burger buns, and top with the burger and a handful of salad. Share remaining salad between plates and serve wedges alongside.
