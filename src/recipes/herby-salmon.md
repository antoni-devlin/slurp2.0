**Do the prep.** Preheat the oven to salmon packet instructions. Put a large saucepan of water on to boil with 1/2 tsp salt. Chop the potato into 2cm chunks. Thinly slice the red onion. Trim the green beans. Grate the garlic. Pop the potato into the boiling water and simmer for 15-20 minutes.

**Prep the salmon.** Roughly chop the parsley. Put half the parsley in a small bowl and mix in the panko breadcrumbs, herbs de provence, olive oil, and season with salt. Put the salmon on a bacon tray and season with salt and pepper. Spread the mayo over the top of each salmon fillet and then sprinkle over the crumb mixture.

**Cook the salmon**. Roast the salmon in the oven until cooked (check packet instructions). Heat oil in a frying pan over medium heat, add the onion and cook until soft, 7-10 minutes.

**Make the mash.** Once the potatoes are cooked, drain in a colander and return to the pan off the heat. Add a knob of butter and a splash of milk and mash until smooth. Season, then stir in the cooked onion.

**Cook the beans.** Heat a splash of oil in a frying pan on high heat. Stir-fry the green beans for 2 minutes. Add the garlic and season with salt. Add 75ml of water, put a lid on the pan and steam until tender, 3-5 minutes. Drain any leftover water, then stir through the balsamic vinegar and olive oil.

**Finish and serve.** Spoon the onion mash onto the plates, top with the salmon and green beans. Drizzle the balsamic dressing from the beans around the plate and finish with a sprinkling of the remaining parsley.
