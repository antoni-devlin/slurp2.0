**Cook the spaghetti.** Bring a saucepan of water to the boil and add 1/2 tsp of salt. Add the spaghetti and simmer until tender, 8 minutes. Once cooked, drain in a colander, put back in the saucepan, and drizzle with oil to stop it from sticking together.

**Get prepped.** Finely dice the shallot. Chop the pepper into 1cm sized chunks. Grate the garlic.

**Get cooking.** Heat a drizzle of oil in a frying pan on medium-high heat. Fry the plant-based meatballs until starting to brown, 5-6 minutes, turning frequently. Transfer to a plate when browned. Then fry the shallot until softened, 2-3 minutes. Add the pepper and fry for a further 2-3 minutes.

**Make it saucy.** Add the garlic, tomato puree, and Italian herbs to the veggies and stir through for 1 minute. Add the chopped tomatoes, a sprinkle of basil, a vegetable stock cube, and 100ml water. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and put the meatballs back in. Simmer until the meatballs are hot and the sauce has thickened, 5-6 minutes.

**Finish off.** Once cooked, season the sauce and add the pasta to the pan along with half of the Parmesan and mix together to combine.

**Serve up.** Divide the pasta between bowls, and sprinkle with the remaining Parmesan.
