**Prep the veggies.** Drain the tofu and cut into thin triangles, then coat in the BBQ sauce and put aside. Finely slice the spring onion, crush the garlic cloves, halve the pak choi lengthways. Put the dried mushrooms in a heatproof bowl and cover with 800ml boiling water; set aside for 30 minutes.

**Begin cooking.** Heat 1 tbsp sesame oil in a large saucepan over a low heat. Cook the spring onion whites and garlic for 2-3 minutes until softened. Add the miso and the soy sauce and cook for 2 minutes more. Add the dried mushrooms and their liquid and mix thoroughly. Increase the heat to medium-low and simmer for 10 minutes. Stir in the oat milk and season with black pepper and extra soy sauce to taste.

**Tofu time.** Heat a large frying pan over a high heat. Brush the cut sides of the pak choi with 1 tsp oil, arrange cut-side down in the pan and sear for 5 minutes or until lightly charred. Transfer to a plate and cover to keep warm. Add another 1 tsp oil to the pan, decrease the heat to medium and add the tofu in a single layer. Cook for 4-5 minutes each side until lightly charred.

**Add the noodles.** Cook the noodles to pack instructions until al dente. Meanwhile, put a steamer or colander over them and steam the sugarsnap peas for 5 minutes, or until tender but still crunchy. Drain the noodles, toss in the remaining sesame oil and set aside. Gently reheat the broth over a medium-low heat.

**Serve.** Divide the noodles and broth between the bowls. Top with the pak choi, sugarsnap peas and tofu, and a boiled egg if you like. Scatter with the spring onion greens and fresh red chilli.
