Drain and rinse the mixed beans. Pop into a bowl and roghly mash with the back of a fork or a potato masher. Trim the spring onions, then slice thinly. Grate the cheddar cheese. Add the spring onion, cheese, chipotle paste, and tomato puree to the beans. Season with salt and pepper, and a pinch of sugar. Mix well.

Lay the tortillas out on a board. Spread a little of the bean mix over half of each, leaving a small border round the edge, then fold the tortillas in half to make half moon shapes. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large frying pan on a medium-high heat.

When hot, carefully lay the quesadillas in the pan. Fry until golden, 2 mins each side. Turn carefully. Lightly press down on the torillas with a spatulla to ensure they stick otgether and brown nicely.

While the quesadillas are frying, roughly chop the avocado and halve the tomatoes. In a large bowl, combine the balsamic vinegar with the olive oil. Season, and add rocket tomatoes and avocado; toss gently.

Serve the quesadillas alongside plenty of rocket salad.
