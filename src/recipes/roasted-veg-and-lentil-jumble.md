**Get chopping**. Preheat the oven to 200C. Halve the pepper and discard the core and seeds. Slice into thin strips. Halve and peel the onion. Cut one half into 3 wedges, thinly slice the other halve. Chop the sweet potatoes into 2cm chunks. Halve the tomatoes. Peel and grate the garlic.

**Get roasting.** Pop the sweet potato, pepper strips and onion wedges onto a large baking tray. Drizzle with olive oil then add the harissa paste. Season with salt and pepper and toss to coat. Roast in oven until tender and golden, 25-30 minutes. Halfway through cooking, turn the veg, then add the tomatoes to the tray to roast for the remaining 10-15 minutes.

**Toast the nuts.** Crumble the feta into small pieces. Zest the lemon, cut into wedges. Finely chop the coriander, drain and rinse the lentils in a sieve. Heat a frying pan over medium heat. Once hot, add the flaked almonds and toast until lightly brown, 2-3 minutes, stirring regularly. Remove the almonds to a bowl and set aside.

**Make the drizzle.** Squeeze the lemon juice into a bowl and add the olive oil. Season and add the coriander and mix together.

**Lentil time.** Heat a drizzle of oil in the frying pan on medium-high heat, add the sliced onion and cook until soft, 5-6 minutes. Add the garlic and ground cumin to the onion, stir and cook for 1 minute. Pour in 75ml water and stir in the veg stock powder. Bring to the boil, simmer until the water has reduced by half, 2-3 minutes. Stir in the lentils and cook for 2-3 minutes, then remove from the heat.

**Dish up.** Once the veg has finished cooking, remove from the oven and add the vegetables to the lentil pan. Add the lemon zest and mix together. Serve into large bowls, with the feta and toasted almonds sprinkled on top. Spoon over the herby drizzle.
