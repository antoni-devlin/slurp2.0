**Prepare the veg.** Cut the broccoli into small florets. Finely slice the garlic cloves. Zest the lemon.

**Cook the veg.** Boil half the broccoli for 4 minutes. Add half the peas after 1 minute. Drain, reserving the cooking water. Refresh under the cold tap and drain again.

**Make the sauce**. Put the cooked vegetables in a small food processor with half the garlic, 2 tbsp oil, the basil stalks and most of the leaves, the cashews, the lemon zest and juice, and 1 tbsp of water. Blitz to form a sauce, then season to taste.

**Cook the remaining veg.** Fry the rest of the garlic in a small frying pan over medium-low heat until pale golden. Bring the cooking water back to the boil, add the pasta, and simmer for 7 minutes. Add the kale, the remaining broccoli and peas, and simmer for 3-4 minutes until the pasta is al dente and the veg is tender.

**Finish up**. Drain, reserving 150ml cooking water. Return to the saucepan and stir in the sauce and reserved cooking water, tossing to coat thoroughly. Divide between bowls, and top with the garlic and remaining basil leaves.
